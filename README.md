# bookstore-sample-app

This is a very simple demo application meant to be used as an application-under-test for trying out sample UI/API tests.

To run the application locally on Windows, you can:

1. Clone this repository locally (requires [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed) or just click "Clone or download" > "Download ZIP" do download a copy of it
2. Install .Net Core SDK (version 2.1 or greater) from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)
3. Install Node.js (version 8.11.3 or greater) from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Execute the run.cmd file in the root of this repository (you may need to wait a while until all dependencies get installed and the application is running)
6. You can open the SPA application in the browser on `http://localhost:4200`
7. You can access the API on `http://localhost:5000/api`
